description="Have you ever been bothered by the vast amount of things which aren't synced by Online Party? I have, when it was originally announced I hoped it would bring loads of new potential to how we would play the game! Then it ended up having almost none of the features I was wanting...[br][br][br]This is a new era though, so it's about time we change that.
